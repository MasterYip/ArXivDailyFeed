Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an\nadditional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on\nVLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this\npaper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates\nthe strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single\nlarge language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the\ngeneration gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the\ndiffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe,\nwe find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other\nbut also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we\ndesign a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these\ntwo predictions, leading to more robust control.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for\nenabling collision-free flight in cluttered environments without explicitly\nconstructing 3D maps or generating and tracking collision-free trajectories.\nInstead, we leverage Model Predictive Control (MPC) to directly produce safe\nactions from sparse waypoints and point clouds from a depth camera.

To achieve this, we introduce a dual KD-Tree\nmechanism: the Obstacle KD-Tree quickly identifies the nearest obstacle for\navoidance, while the Edge KD-Tree provides a robust initial guess for the MPC\nsolver, preventing it from getting stuck in local minima during obstacle\navoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and\nreal-world experiments. The results show that our approach significantly\noutperforms the mapping-based methods and is also superior to imitation\nlearning-based methods, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance at up to 12\nm/s in simulations and 6 m/s in real-world tests.

Traditional\nmotion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in\nclutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without\ncontact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g., brushing a\nsoft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g., toppling a glass vase). Due to this\ndiversity, it is difficult to characterize which contacts may be acceptable or\nunacceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning\nframework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment\nsemantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact\nbased on object properties and locations.

Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that\nare sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often\nstruggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose\nEquivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline\nthat estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3)\nequivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface\nto the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features\nregress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an\ninner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show\nthat ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both\ntightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose\nclothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%).

Existing\ntraining-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but\nrequire costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain\nperformance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal\nthat the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the\naccelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight\nintroduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to\nmaintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this\nfinding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token\ncompression framework.

However,\nthe quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to\nscalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While\nthe linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative,\nexisting RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small,\ndomain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a\nframework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS\nfoundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances\nscalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive\nlearning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware\npretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to\nhandle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2)\nmulti-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in\nobject scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate\nthat Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance\nscaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments\nacross scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks\ndemonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based\ncounterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

We improve upon these methods with\nSMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics), which\nfaithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key\nlimitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training\nformulation, and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For\ntraining, most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted\nface mesh with the input image, along with a plethora of additional loss\nfunctions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide\nsupervision to optimize for 3D face geometry, camera, albedo, and lighting,\nwhich is an ill-posed optimization problem, but the domain gap between\nrendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead, SMIRK\nreplaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that,\ngiven the rendered predicted mesh geometry, and sparsely sampled pixels of the\ninput image, generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color\ninformation from sampled image pixels, supervising with neural rendering-based\nreconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further, it enables us to\ngenerate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training.\nThese are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as\nsupervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training\ndata and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative,\nquantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK\nachieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression\nreconstruction.

This is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio\nto capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a\ntwo-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated\nby a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically\naligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model.\nWe introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the\nseparated audio signals. In the second stage, efficient image generation is\nachieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition\nusing only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset\nas the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The\nexperiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source\naudio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art methods in 17 of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and\ndelivers superior visual quality.

Due to the heavy cost of\nannotating region-wise quality, the lack of ground truth constraints from\nrelevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception.\nInspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the\nlocal texture of different regions and their visual saliency, we propose a\nKaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework, which aims to\neffectively assess both saliency and local texture, thereby facilitating the\nassessment of global quality.

However, these\nprior models treat molecules merely as discrete atom sets, overlooking the\nspace surrounding them. We argue from a physical perspective that only modeling\nthese discrete points is insufficient. We first present a simple yet insightful\nobservation: naively adding randomly sampled virtual points beyond atoms can\nsurprisingly enhance MPR performance. In light of this, we propose a principled\nframework that incorporates the entire 3D space spanned by molecules. We\nimplement the framework via a novel Transformer-based architecture, dubbed\nSpaceFormer, with three key components: (1) grid-based space discretization;\n(2) grid sampling/merging; and (3) efficient 3D positional encoding.

A key\nchallenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations,\nnoted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for\nimprovement.

This is especially\nan issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only\nprovide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging\nFidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical\nreconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner.

This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge\nfrom each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already\nundermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each\nclient. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the\ncentral server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions\nor connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a\ndecentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework,\nclients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other.

SIC causes\nthe system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing\nsampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields\nfor generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed\nGenerative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for\nnear-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a\nnuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat\nBath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to\nhigh-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional\nHB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers\nfrom a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation\nalways occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and\nhigher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not\nconsidered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a\npart of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those\nresidual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency.

We show theoretically that exchanging\npolicy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even\ncentralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate this happening empirically, by an even greater margin than in\ntabular settings, and show that the communication network allows decentralised\nagents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.\n","authors":["Patrick Benjamin","Alessandro Abate"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11607v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10352v1","updated":"2025-03-13T13:28:54Z","published":"2025-03-13T13:28:54Z","title":"Safe exploration in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces","summary":"  Popular safe Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms learn control policies for\nsafety-critical systems in unknown environments.

Due to the lack of dedicated benchmark datasets for evaluating the\nautomated solving of OR problems, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising\n83 real-world OR problems described in natural language. We conduct comparative\nexperiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs, including GPT-o3-mini,\nDeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.

We study optimal demand response\nin a setting where consumers use home energy management systems (HEMS) to\nautonomously adjust their electricity consumption. Our core assumption is that\nHEMS operationalize flexibility by querying the consumer for their preferences\nand computing the ``indifference set'' of all energy consumption profiles that\ncan be used to satisfy these preferences. Then, given an indifference set, HEMS\ncan respond to grid signals while guaranteeing user-defined comfort and\nfunctionality; e.g., if a consumer sets a temperature range, a HEMS can precool\nand preheat to align with peak renewable production, thus improving efficiency\nwithout sacrificing comfort. We show that while price-based mechanisms are not\ngenerally optimal for demand response, they become asymptotically optimal in\nlarge markets under a mean-field limit.

This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from\nmulti - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large\narea, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing\nthe total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through\nspecific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space\nconsists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue\nlengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The\naction space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its\nphase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on\nalleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time\nwhile considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with\nthe SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is\nevaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments\nare made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion.\nFor example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios\ntested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and\nminimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably\ndecreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic\nconditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional\ntraffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic\nmanagement.\n","authors":["Qiang Li","Jin Niu","Qin Luo","Lina Yu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09252v1.pdf","comment":"16 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:2503.02279"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09239v1","updated":"2025-03-12T10:34:31Z","published":"2025-03-12T10:34:31Z","title":"Risk Assessment of Distribution Networks Considering Climate Change and\n  Vegetation Management Impacts","summary":"  This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment model for power\ndistribution networks with a focus on the influence of climate conditions and\nvegetation management on outage risks.

The first phase involves\nan interactive process between the DM and the decision analyst, in which a\nmodified version of Deck-of-Cards (DoC) method is proposed to construct T1FS\nmembership functions on a ratio scale. We then extend this method to\nincorporate ambiguity in subjective judgment and that resulted in an IT2FS\nmodel that better captures uncertainty in DM's linguistic assessments. The\nsecond phase formalizes the constructed IT2FS model for application in MCDM by\ndefining an appropriate mathematical representation of such information,\naggregation rules, and an admissible ordering principle. The proposed framework\nenhances the reliability and effectiveness of fuzzy decision-making not only by\naccurately representing DM's personalized semantics of linguistic information.\n","authors":["Bapi Dutta","Diego García-Zamora","José Rui Figueira","Luis Martínez"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01413v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03924v2","updated":"2025-03-11T15:22:55Z","published":"2024-10-04T21:03:16Z","title":"Online Control-Informed Learning","summary":"  This paper proposes an Online Control-Informed Learning (OCIL) framework,\nwhich employs the well-established optimal control and state estimation\ntechniques in the field of control to solve a broad class of learning tasks in\nan online fashion.

The\nnumber of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization\nquality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum\nis discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to\nhigh dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process\nThompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner-\nand outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI\nand GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other\nposterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy\nsearch. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which\nhas a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the\ncost of one posterior sample.

Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches\nthat restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy\nleverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way\nthat partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can\nbe easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the\nmaximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods.\nSimulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time\nfor vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of\nthe held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed\napproach.
