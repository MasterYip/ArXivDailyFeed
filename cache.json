Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an\nadditional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on\nVLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this\npaper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates\nthe strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single\nlarge language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the\ngeneration gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the\ndiffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe,\nwe find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other\nbut also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we\ndesign a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these\ntwo predictions, leading to more robust control.

To achieve this, we introduce a dual KD-Tree\nmechanism: the Obstacle KD-Tree quickly identifies the nearest obstacle for\navoidance, while the Edge KD-Tree provides a robust initial guess for the MPC\nsolver, preventing it from getting stuck in local minima during obstacle\navoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and\nreal-world experiments.

Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that\nare sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often\nstruggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose\nEquivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline\nthat estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3)\nequivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface\nto the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features\nregress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an\ninner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show\nthat ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both\ntightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose\nclothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%).

Existing\ntraining-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but\nrequire costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain\nperformance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal\nthat the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the\naccelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight\nintroduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to\nmaintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this\nfinding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token\ncompression framework.

However,\nthe quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to\nscalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While\nthe linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative,\nexisting RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small,\ndomain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a\nframework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS\nfoundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances\nscalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive\nlearning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware\npretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to\nhandle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2)\nmulti-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in\nobject scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate\nthat Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance\nscaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments\nacross scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks\ndemonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based\ncounterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

We improve upon these methods with\nSMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics), which\nfaithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key\nlimitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training\nformulation, and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For\ntraining, most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted\nface mesh with the input image, along with a plethora of additional loss\nfunctions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide\nsupervision to optimize for 3D face geometry, camera, albedo, and lighting,\nwhich is an ill-posed optimization problem, but the domain gap between\nrendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead, SMIRK\nreplaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that,\ngiven the rendered predicted mesh geometry, and sparsely sampled pixels of the\ninput image, generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color\ninformation from sampled image pixels, supervising with neural rendering-based\nreconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further, it enables us to\ngenerate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training.\nThese are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as\nsupervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training\ndata and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative,\nquantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK\nachieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression\nreconstruction.

To bridge this gap, a\nmethod called MACS is proposed to conduct multi-source audio-to-image\ngeneration. This is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio\nto capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a\ntwo-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated\nby a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically\naligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model.\nWe introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the\nseparated audio signals. In the second stage, efficient image generation is\nachieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition\nusing only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset\nas the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark.

While catastrophic\nforgetting has been extensively studied, overfitting in FSCIL, especially with\nlarge foundation models, has received less attention.

Specifically, SVFCL applies singular value\ndecomposition to the foundation model weights, keeping the singular vectors\nfixed while fine-tuning the singular values for each task, and then merging\nthem. This simple yet effective approach not only alleviates the forgetting\nproblem but also mitigates overfitting more effectively while significantly\nreducing trainable parameters.

This critical\nabsence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the\nperturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing\nthe attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core\nsemantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets\nand methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic\nclarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus\nensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by\nconcentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying\nthem uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective\nsolution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly\nby a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the\ntarget image in the embedding space.

Principled solutions to reward hacking have\nbeen impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this\ngap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation\nbetween proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"reference\npolicy\" that breaks down under optimization.

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able\nto simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical\nproperties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method\nentail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine\nlearning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To\nensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including\nthose not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of\nthe network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts\nglobal quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern\ntransformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and\ndata-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model.\nThe starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects\ntranslation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions\n(i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale\nin-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars,\nvectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress\nand stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model\nequivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean\ngroup E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and\ndata-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an\nefficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use\nonly the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to\nachieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.\n","authors":["Fleur Hendriks","Vlado Menkovski","Martin DoÅ¡kÃ¡Å","Marc G.

This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge\nfrom each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already\nundermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each\nclient. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the\ncentral server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions\nor connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a\ndecentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework,\nclients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other.

SIC causes\nthe system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing\nsampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields\nfor generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed\nGenerative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for\nnear-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a\nnuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat\nBath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to\nhigh-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional\nHB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers\nfrom a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation\nalways occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and\nhigher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not\nconsidered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a\npart of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those\nresidual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency.

Image watermarking allows responsible\nmodel owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate\nthe harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain\nvulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part\nbecause watermarks distort the distribution of generated images,\nunintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.\n  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for\nimages, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the\nwatermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to\nall previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a\ntwo-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we\naugment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information\nabout the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the\nrelevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial\nnoise that might match our image.

However, it\nsuffers from high computational complexity and the inability to directly\nspecify the rank. This work introduces a novel framework for low-rank matrix\nregression that addresses both unstructured and Hankel matrices. By decomposing\nthe low-rank matrix into rank-1 bases, the problem is reformulated as an\ninfinite-dimensional sparse learning problem. The least-angle regression (LAR)\nalgorithm is then employed to solve this problem efficiently. For unstructured\nmatrices, a closed-form LAR solution is derived with equivalence to a\nnormalized nuclear norm regularization problem. For Hankel matrices, a\nreal-valued polynomial basis reformulation enables effective LAR\nimplementation. Two numerical examples in network modeling and system\nrealization demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms\nthe nuclear norm method in terms of estimation accuracy and computational\nefficiency.\n","authors":["Mingzhou Yin","Matthias A.

Prior knowledge of customer\ninterruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load\npickup (CLPU), is essential for effective decision-making. However, both CIC\nand CLPU are reciprocally influenced by the realized customer interruption\nduration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model,\nespecially given the limited understanding of their underlying physical\nmechanisms. This paper proposes a novel and tractable modeling approach to\ncapture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns derived from\ndata that reflect observable surface - level correlations rather than\nunderlying mechanisms - thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these\ndecision-dependent factors. Specifically, quadratic functions are employed to\nmodel the increasing rate of CIC with respect to CID according to data fitting\nresults.

We study optimal demand response\nin a setting where consumers use home energy management systems (HEMS) to\nautonomously adjust their electricity consumption. Our core assumption is that\nHEMS operationalize flexibility by querying the consumer for their preferences\nand computing the ``indifference set'' of all energy consumption profiles that\ncan be used to satisfy these preferences. Then, given an indifference set, HEMS\ncan respond to grid signals while guaranteeing user-defined comfort and\nfunctionality; e.g., if a consumer sets a temperature range, a HEMS can precool\nand preheat to align with peak renewable production, thus improving efficiency\nwithout sacrificing comfort. We show that while price-based mechanisms are not\ngenerally optimal for demand response, they become asymptotically optimal in\nlarge markets under a mean-field limit.

While\ndeep reinforcement learning approaches that integrate human-robot interaction\n(HRI) with path planning have demonstrated strong benchmark performance, they\noften struggle to adapt to new scenarios and environments. LLMs offer a\npromising avenue for zero-shot navigation through commonsense inference.\nHowever, most existing LLM-based frameworks rely on centralized\ndecision-making, lack robust verification mechanisms, and face inconsistencies\nin translating macro-actions into precise low-level control signals. To address\nthese challenges, we propose SAMALM, a decentralized multi-agent LLM\nactor-critic framework for multi-robot social navigation.

An\nentropy-based score fusion mechanism further enhances self-verification and\nre-query, improving both robustness and coordination.

However, existing methods primarily rely on\nimplicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks\nor per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the\nreconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing\nmethods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application.\nTo address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel\nframework that uses motion graph as an explicit and sparse motion\nrepresentation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual Gaussians\nvia dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions\ndetermining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are\njointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments\nshow that MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset\nwhile being competitive on HyperNeRF.

However, achieving real-time\ndecision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by\naccurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper\npresents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for\nreal-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named\nTime-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional\nMPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of\npredicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot\n(multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy\nDeposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking\nto ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser\npower to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that\nTiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth.\nSecond, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature\ntracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted\ndilution range (10\\%-30\\%), reducing potential porosity defects.

Different from\nmulti - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large\narea, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing\nthe total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through\nspecific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space\nconsists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue\nlengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The\naction space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its\nphase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on\nalleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time\nwhile considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with\nthe SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is\nevaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments\nare made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion.\nFor example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios\ntested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and\nminimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably\ndecreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic\nconditions.

In\naddition, we propose a block coordinate ascent algorithm and prove its\nconvergence to global optimum, as well as the rate of convergence. Second, when\nuncertainty arises from the left-hand side of a pessimistic two-sided chance\nconstraint, we show the convexity if the Wasserstein ball is centered around an\nelliptical and star-unimodal distribution. In addition, we propose a family of\nsecond-order conic inner approximations, and we bound their approximation error\nand prove their asymptotic exactness. Furthermore, we extend the convexity\nresults to optimistic chance constraints.\n","authors":["Haoming Shen","Ruiwei Jiang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02486v2.pdf","comment":"Keywords: Chance constraints; Convexity; Wasserstein ambiguity;\n  Distributionally robust optimization; Distributionally optimistic\n  optimization"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09848v1","updated":"2025-03-12T21:11:17Z","published":"2025-03-12T21:11:17Z","title":"A second order numerical scheme for optimal control of non-linear\n  Fokker-Planck equations and applications in social dynamics","summary":"  In this work, we present a second-order numerical scheme to address the\nsolution of optimal control problems constrained by the evolution of nonlinear\nFokker-Planck equations arising from socio-economic dynamics.

The key observation is that the usual input-output\nlinearization problem can be interpreted as the problem of solving simultaneous\nlinear equations associated with the input gain matrix: thus, even at points\nwhere the input gain matrix becomes singular, it is still possible to solve a\npart of linear equations, by which a subset of input-output relations is made\nlinear or close to be linear. Based on this observation, we adopt the task\npriority-based approach in the input-output linearization problem. First, we\ngeneralize the classical Byrnes-Isidori normal form to a prioritized normal\nform having a triangular structure, so that the singularity of a subblock of\nthe input gain matrix related to lower-priority tasks does not directly\npropagate to higher-priority tasks.

We first propose a fluid approximation based pricing and\nmax-weight matching policy, which achieves an $O(\\sqrt{\\eta})$ optimality rate\nwhen all the arrival rates are scaled by $\\eta$. We further show that a\ntwo-price and max-weight matching policy achieves an improved $O(\\eta^{1/3})$\noptimality rate. Under a broad class of pricing policies, we prove that any\nmatching policy has an optimality rate that is lower bounded by\n$\\Omega(\\eta^{1/3})$. Thus, the latter policy achieves the optimal rate with\nrespect to $\\eta$. We also demonstrate the advantage of max-weight matching\nwith respect to the number of server and customer types $n$. Under a complete\nresource pooling condition, we show that max-weight matching achieves\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n^{1/3})$ optimality rates for static and two-price\npolicies, respectively, and the latter matches the lower bound\n$\\Omega(n^{1/3})$. In comparison, the randomized matching policy may have an\n$\\Omega(n)$ optimality rate.\n","authors":["Sushil Mahavir Varma","Pornpawee Bumpensanti","Siva Theja Maguluri","He Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02213v4.pdf","comment":"Conference Version published in ACM Sigmetrics 2020 and Journal\n  Version published in Operations Research"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02572v2","updated":"2025-03-11T16:21:33Z","published":"2024-08-05T15:46:57Z","title":"Non-commutative optimization problems with differential constraints","summary":"  Non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO) problems seek to minimize the\nstate average of a polynomial of some operator variables, subject to polynomial\nconstraints, over all states and operators, as well as the Hilbert spaces where\nthose might be defined.

However, conventional fuzzy sets, often\nreferred to as type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) have limitations in capturing higher\nlevels of uncertainty, particularly when decision-makers (DMs) express\nhesitation or ambiguity in membership degree. To address this, Interval Type-2\nFuzzy Sets (IT2FSs) have been introduced by incorporating uncertainty in\nmembership degree allocation, which enhanced flexibility in modelling\nsubjective judgments. Despite their advantages, existing IT2FS construction\nmethods often lack active involvement from DMs and that limits the\ninterpretability and effectiveness of decision models. This study proposes a\nsocio-technical co-constructive approach for developing IT2FS models of\nlinguistic terms by facilitating the active involvement of DMs in preference\nelicitation and its application in multicriteria decision-making (MCDM)\nproblems. Our methodology is structured in two phases. The first phase involves\nan interactive process between the DM and the decision analyst, in which a\nmodified version of Deck-of-Cards (DoC) method is proposed to construct T1FS\nmembership functions on a ratio scale. We then extend this method to\nincorporate ambiguity in subjective judgment and that resulted in an IT2FS\nmodel that better captures uncertainty in DM's linguistic assessments. The\nsecond phase formalizes the constructed IT2FS model for application in MCDM by\ndefining an appropriate mathematical representation of such information,\naggregation rules, and an admissible ordering principle.

For a human-in-the-loop\nlanguage-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language\ncommands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real\ntime. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe\noperating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization\nframework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon,\nensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we\nconsider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a\nnovel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera\nwhich has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less\nbaseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to\nconvert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection\nmodel identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to\ngenerate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin\nAlgorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs\nscene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint\nwithin the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky\nobservations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe\nconditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe\nnavigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in\nthe Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves\n64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in\ntrajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.\n","authors":["Sourav Sanyal","Kaushik Roy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10283v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07858v1","updated":"2025-03-10T21:11:25Z","published":"2025-03-10T21:11:25Z","title":"Real-Time Line Parameter Estimation Method for Multi-Phase Unbalanced\n  Distribution Networks","summary":"  An accurate distribution network model is crucial for monitoring, state\nestimation and energy management.

Then, by accounting for the\nobtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one\ncan guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While\nexisting approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model,\nthus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we\nexplicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS)\noptimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a\nrational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model\nand, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS\noptimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions\nfor unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming.

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneralized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function\n(CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution\nand ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the\nagents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can\ndetect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is\nachieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to\nprevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium.\nTo avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original\ntask-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk\nmeasurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to\nadaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the\nagents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or\ndeactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task\nefficiency.

The key insight is, through simply employing the large step\nsize large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit\nregularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent\nmodel learning spurious signals. The model reaches the invariant solution after\ncertain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data\nwould simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals.

We show that the planner produces\ntrajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness\nmeasure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference.\nOverall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in\nCoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline.\nFinally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and\ndisturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.\n","authors":["Alexander Schperberg","Marcel Menner","Stefano Di Cairano"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06050v1.pdf","comment":"8 pages, 8 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11790v3","updated":"2025-03-08T03:19:42Z","published":"2023-10-18T08:29:03Z","title":"Finite Sample Performance Analysis of MIMO Systems Identification","summary":"  This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of\nan n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear\nTime-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs.

The Lagrangian dynamic model of the wrist is established,\nalong with a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) designed for\ntrajectory tracking tasks. A prototype of the robotic wrist is developed, and\nextensive experiments are conducted to validate its superior motion performance\nand the proposed dynamic model. Subsequently, extensive comparative experiments\nbetween NMPC and PID controller were conducted under various operating\nconditions.

Towards formally verifying properties of\nstochastic systems, methods based on discrete, finite Markov approximations --\nabstractions -- thereof have surged in recent years. These are found in\ncontexts where: either a) one only has partial, discrete observations of the\nunderlying continuous stochastic process, or b) the original system is too\ncomplex to analyze, so one partitions the continuous state-space of the\noriginal system to construct a handleable, finite-state model thereof. In both\ncases, the abstraction is an approximation of the discrete stochastic process\nthat arises precisely from the discretization of the underlying continuous\nprocess. The fact that the abstraction is Markov and the discrete process is\nnot (even though the original one is) leads to approximation errors. Towards\naccounting for non-Markovianity, we introduce memory-dependent abstractions for\nstochastic systems, capturing dynamics with memory effects. Our contribution is\ntwofold. First, we provide a formalism for memory-dependent abstractions based\non transfer operators. Second, we quantify the approximation error by upper\nbounding the total variation distance between the true continuous state\ndistribution and its discrete approximation.\n","authors":["Adrien Banse","Giannis Delimpaltadakis","Luca Laurenti","Manuel Mazo Jr.","RaphaÃ«l M.

To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of\nhighly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide\nheating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer\ntime series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but\nnot both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across\ndifferent buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this\npaper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand\ntime series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach\nintegrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that\naccount for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a\ncost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy\ndevelopment, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data\ncan be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or\nto analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications\nof this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we\nprepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298\nresidential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different\npathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly\navailable data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European\nregions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of\ndecarbonization strategies.\n","authors":["Simon Malacek","JosÃ© Portela","Yannick Marcus Werner","Sonja Wogrin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05427v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03425v2","updated":"2025-03-07T13:53:07Z","published":"2024-01-07T09:04:38Z","title":"Uncertainty Propagation and Bayesian Fusion on Unimodular Lie Groups\n  from a Parametric Perspective","summary":"  We address the problem of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian fusion on\nunimodular Lie groups.

It can be stored in large quantities, decoupling\nrenewable energy generation from its use, and is therefore considered essential\nfor achieving a climate-neutral economy. The intermittency of renewable energy\ngeneration and the stochastic nature of demand are, however, challenging\nfactors for the dynamic planning of hydrogen storage and transportation. This\nholds particularly in the early-adoption phase when hydrogen distribution\noccurs through vehicle-based networks. We therefore address the Dynamic\nInventory Routing Problem (DIRP) under stochastic supply and demand with direct\ndeliveries for the vehicle-based distribution of hydrogen. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework that\nintegrates constraints into the learning process and incorporates parameterized\npost-decision state value predictions. Additionally, we introduce\nLookahead-based CRL (LCRL), which improves decision-making over a multi-period\nhorizon to enhance short-term planning while maintaining the value predictions.\nOur computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CRL and LCRL across\ndiverse instances. Our learning methods provide near-optimal solutions on small\nscale instances that are solved via value iteration. Furthermore, both methods\noutperform typical deep learning approaches such as Proximal Policy\nOptimization, as well as classical inventory heuristics, such as\n(s,S)-policy-based and Power-of-Two-based heuristics. Furthermore, LCRL\nachieves a 10% improvement over CRL on average, albeit with higher\ncomputational requirements. Analyses of optimal replenishment policies reveal\nthat accounting for stochastic supply and demand influences these policies,\nshowing the importance of our addition to the DIRP.\n","authors":["Umur Hasturk","Albert H.

We address\nthis scenario through a distributed algorithm that combines three key\ncomponents: (i) a learning part that leverages neural networks to learn the\nlocal cost functions descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine that\nsteers the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global\ncost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism that locally reconstructs the unavailable\nglobal quantities. By using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale\nseparation and averaging theory, we formally prove that, in strongly convex\nsetups, the overall distributed strategy linearly converges in a neighborhood\nof the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities\nof the neural networks.

Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the\nnon-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov\nstability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the\ninner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output\ntracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference\ntracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined.

The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires\nhybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional onboard hardware to monitor the\npropagation environment and perform local channel estimation (CHEST), a process\nknown as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a\nform of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter\nthe propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other\ncommunicating devices sharing the environment. Although implementation\ncomplexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely\nunexplored.

As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general\nspectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build\nmatrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several\nconstructions that could increase the size of these matrices.

Combined with conditions for load\nstatics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the\n$n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere\nwith non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers\nwhile the load is still.

To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a\npseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the\nstructural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured\nuncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value\nframework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an\nestimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as\nthe forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity\nstructure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible\nCouette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains\nidentify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated\nstructure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach\nnumber, that takes the form of an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic\nMach numbers.

Empirical evidence\nhas shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well.\nHowever, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between\ntrajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance\nlacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant\nof the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via\nimportance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the\ngradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent,\nand reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further\napply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as\ntrust region policy optimization.

We investigate the advantages and\ndisadvantages of using a deterministic global solver (MAiNGO) compared to\nconventional local and stochastic global solvers (L-BFGS-B and multi-start,\nrespectively) for the optimization of the acquisition function. For CPU\nefficiency, we set a time limit for MAiNGO, taking the best point as optimal.\nWe perform repeated numerical experiments, initially using the Muller-Brown\npotential as a benchmark function, utilizing the lower confidence bound\nacquisition function; we further validate our findings with three alternative\nbenchmark functions. Statistical analysis reveals that when the acquisition\nfunction is more exploitative (as opposed to exploratory), BO with MAiNGO\nconverges in fewer iterations than with the local solvers. However, when the\ndataset lacks diversity, or when the acquisition function is overly\nexploitative, BO with MAiNGO, compared to the local solvers, is more likely to\nconverge to a local rather than a global ly near-optimal solution of the\nblack-box function. L-BFGS-B and multi-start mitigate this risk in BO by\nintroducing stochasticity in the selection of the next sampling point, which\nenhances the exploration of uncharted regions in the search space and reduces\ndependence on acquisition function hyperparameters. Ultimately, suboptimal\noptimization of poorly chosen acquisition functions may be preferable to their\noptimal solution. When the acquisition function is more exploratory, BO with\nMAiNGO, multi-start, and L-BFGS-B achieve comparable probabilities of\nconvergence to a globally near-optimal solution (although BO with MAiNGO may\nrequire more iterations to converge under these conditions).\n","authors":["Anastasia Georgiou","Daniel Jungen","Luise Kaven","Verena Hunstig","Constantine Frangakis","Ioannis Kevrekidis","Alexander Mitsos"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03625v1.pdf","comment":"32 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06712v4","updated":"2025-03-05T15:40:42Z","published":"2024-07-09T09:39:45Z","title":"MDP Geometry, Normalization and Reward Balancing Solvers","summary":"  We present a new geometric interpretation of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\nwith a natural normalization procedure that allows us to adjust the value\nfunction at each state without altering the advantage of any action with\nrespect to any policy.
